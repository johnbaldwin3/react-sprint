## Defining ESNEXT, What is it?!
What is ESNext? Well simply put, it is ECMAScript of the future.


### ESNext
ECMAScript (JavaScript) developers are always searching for ways to better the programming language and make it more understandable and functionally easier to use. People are continually update the source code and preparing new launches of the programming language, such as the recent release of ES2015 (ES6) syntax.

ESNext is simply a term for what is to come. Some features may be years away from release, while others might be trickling in slowly with each update.

It shouldn't come as a surprise that we have already been using some ESNext features... ES2015 syntax is still not accepted directly by most browsers which is why we use tools such as Babel to help transpile our programming syntax into a ES5 format that the browsers can understand.

#### The Brief History  
For almost 15 years JavaScript remained essentially unchanged, and it was not until recently that the developers (around 2012) there became a push to write code in the new syntaxes available.

This led to a change in the culture of JavaScript - that rather than waiting for giant portions of the code to be re-written and gain support across browsers, that each year there would be smaller implementations for the new standards (syntaxes).

### Conclusion
* ESNext refers to the up and coming new features of ECMAScript (JavaScript) that do not yet have full browser support.
* Often these new features will need to be transpiled into older syntax so they can function across a range of browsers.
* Yearly updates to small portions of code have become the standard in terms of how ES syntaxes will be released moving forward.
* Currently in the works is the ES7 syntax (ES2016) that will push new features out into the world of developers.
